        <h3>A.I. Project Part A - Shortest Winning Sequence</h3>
        <p>IMAGE OF INFEXION</p>
        <p><b>Objective:</b></p>
        <p>In this project, we were required to develop an algorithm to play
            single-player Infexion, where we needed to efficiently identify the optimal
            sequence of moves (fewest possible moves) for red to eliminate all blue
            cells using spread actions.</p>
        <p>Each cell has 1 &le; p &lt; 6, where p is the power level, if a cell power
            exceeds
            5, it is removed from the board. During a spread action, distribute the
            cell's power across a chosen hex direction and cells within that range
            are converted to its colour. See below for a demonstration:</p>

        <p>IMG</p>

        <p><b>Solution:</b></p>
        <p>We used a two part admissible heuristic with our A* algorithm to
            guarentee optimality. In essence, our heuristic is the sum of two
            admissible heuristics. H1 is the minimum cost to rearrange the board
            such that it takes the least amount of spread moves (we called this
            the ideal board). Whereas, H2 calculates the minimum cost required
            to get to this ideal board. </p>
        <p>Please read the full report here, it is very interesting, I promise!

        <h3>A.I. Project Part B - Playing against A.I.</h3>
        <p><b>Objective:</b></p>
        <p>For this second part of the project, we were required to develop an
            A.I. to
            outperform a series of increasingly difficult adverserial search
            agents, that worked within a memory constraint of 250MB, and time
            constraint of 180 seconds per game.</p>

        <p>Solution:</p>
        <p>We used a minimax algorithm with alpha beta pruning, iterative
            deepining, and move ordering. While I can't possibly fit everything
            in our 6 page report here, I would love to talk about our
            4-component heuristic.</p>
        <div>
            <h4>Component 1: Total Power per Side</h4>
            <p><strong>Inspiration:</strong> Similar to the "Material Count" in
                chess, in Infexion, a token’s power is assigned as its value,
                and the Total Power per side is compared.</p>

            <h4>Component 2: Defender Score per Side</h4>
            <p><strong>Inspiration:</strong> Based on "Strong Pawn Structure" in
                chess. In Infexion, a Strong Token Structure is a dense circular
                structure, maximizing the protection among ally tokens.</p>

            <h4>Component 3: Attacker Score per Side</h4>
            <p>This component focuses on the concept of sufficient protection,
                ensuring that ally tokens are protected by an equal number of
                other ally tokens to effectively defend against enemy attacks.
            </p>

            <h4>Component 4: Power Sum of Tokens Insufficiently Protected
                (PSOTIP) per Side</h4>
            <p><strong>Inspiration:</strong> Related to "King Safety" in chess.
                In Infexion, the focus is on high power pieces, as they have a
                larger impact on the board. This component checks the power of
                pieces that are insufficiently protected.</p>

            <h4>Combining All 4 Components: The Entire Heuristic</h4>
            <p>The two main features of the heuristic, Situation Score and
                Effective Power, are constructed from the above components. The
                equation used is: Heuristic = Situation score + Effective Power
                = [ X * diff(Defenders Score) + Y * diff(Attackers Score)] +
                diff[Total Power - PSOTIP], where X and Y are coefficients.
                After extensive testing, X = 0.5 and Y = 0.5 were chosen to
                balance the heuristic.</p>
            <p>These two main features of our heuristic complement each others’
                weaknesses.
            <ul>
                <li>Situation Score: Measures a player’s ability to defend and
                    attack, e.g. the tokens’ positions. However,
                    it treats all tokens equally regardless of their power. But
                    this
                    is addressed by Effective Power.</li>
                <li>
                    Effective Power: Measures the total power a player has,
                    which
                    is sufficiently protected. However, it
                    does not take into account where these sufficiently
                    protected
                    tokens are placed. But this is addressed
                    by Situation Score.
                </li>

            </ul>

        <p><b>Challenges</b></p>
        <p>#1 - communcation of ideas</p>
        <p>As you could see above, due to the many technical concepts and the numerous
            possible
            conditions of the game state, it initially led to slow communication
            and misinteprations with my project partner. This was particularly
            challenging as the success of our algorithms relied heavily on being
            able to communicate nuanced strategies and inner workings of our
            heuristics</p>
        <p>To approach this challenge, we jointly devised a table of
            definitions, which in essence functioned as our ditcionary for in-house
            jargon.
            For example:
        <ul>
            <li>h1-type spread - a token in a stack
                can be spread into any adjacent cell to the previsouly allcoated
                cell, rather than just a linear spread.</li>
            <li>threat reach - consider the positions (not power) of currently occupied
                by an Enemy, count how many of those positions can be spread over by a
                Player
                cell</li>
            <li>developing board - regardless of what has happened before, there does
                not exist a cell that can spread over an enemy cell, otherwise call it a
                "tense board"</li>
        </ul>

        This greatly accelerated our
        collaborative efficiency and helped us maintain precision of
        communication as ideas got more and more complex.</p>
        <p>#2 - team coordination and time managment </p>
        <p>Aligning our hectic schedules were difficult - even using tools such as
            shared calendars weren't of any help due to our busy and messy schedules.
            But, we both knew that collaboration was of utmost importance</p>
        <p>To counteract this, we set clear Milestones in our shared google docs (this
            was before learning about JIRA and Confluence) and use task allocating apps
            such as Trello, which detailed what needed to be done.</p>
        <p>In the end, this ensured that the project momentum did not die down if we
            weren't able to
            secure a meeting during a week</p>

        <p>Results for Part A and B:</p>
        <p>We were very pleased with our results:
        <ul>
            <li>Part A - Shortest Winning Sequence: 7/8 =~ 88%, while the cohort average
                was 65% </li>
            <li> Part B - Playing Against A.I.: 17.5/22 =~ 80%, while the cohort average
                was 70%</li>
        </ul>
        Scores aside, I was very proud of this subject, and it definetly taught me how
        and why it was important to effectively break down complex concepts into much
        simplier ones and
        prioritise mutual understanding rather than digging into the code.
